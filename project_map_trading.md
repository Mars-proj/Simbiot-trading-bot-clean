# Trading Bot Project Map

## Overview
This document outlines the development roadmap for the trading bot system, focusing on trading functionality, symbol selection, backtesting, and live trading.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Initial Setup and Symbol Fetching (Completed)
- [x] Set up project structure and initial files.
- [x] Implement basic logging (`logging_setup.py`).
- [x] Fetch symbols from MEXC via `load_markets()` (`test_symbols.py`).
- [x] Add fallback to public API for symbol fetching (`test_symbols.py`).

### Milestone 2: Symbol Filtering and Validation (Completed)
- [x] Implement symbol validation (`symbol_handler.py`).
- [x] Add filtering by volatility and volume (`token_analyzer.py`, `test_symbols.py`).
- [x] Add filtering by trading signals (RSI) (`signal_generator_indicators.py`, `signal_generator_core.py`, `test_symbols.py`).
- [x] Optimize exchange instance usage to avoid multiple creations (`test_symbols.py`, `symbol_handler.py`, `token_analyzer.py`, `ohlcv_fetcher.py`).
- [x] Add parallel symbol filtering in batches (`test_symbols.py`).
- [x] Add debug logging to track filtering process (`logging_setup.py`, `test_symbols.py`).

### Milestone 3: Backtesting and Live Trading (In Progress)
- [ ] Implement backtesting for selected symbols (`backtest_cycle.py`).
- [ ] Start live trading with symbols that pass backtest (`start_trading_all.py`).
- [ ] Monitor trading performance and log results.

### Milestone 4: Enhancements and Notifications (Planned)
- [ ] Add Telegram notifications for trades and errors.
- [ ] Implement dynamic adjustment of filtering criteria based on market conditions.
- [ ] Add unit tests for critical components.

## Current Status
- As of 2025-04-01, the system is in the symbol filtering phase, processing 2610 symbols in batches of 10.
- Filtering criteria have been relaxed (min_volume_threshold=100, min_volatility_threshold=0.1%), and signal filtering is temporarily disabled to allow more symbols to pass.
- Awaiting completion of filtering to proceed to backtesting and live trading.

## Next Steps
- Monitor symbol filtering progress and ensure valid symbols are selected.
- Proceed to backtesting and live trading once valid symbols are found.
- Add Telegram notifications for monitoring.
