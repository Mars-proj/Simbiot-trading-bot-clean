# Trading Bot Project Map

## Overview
This document outlines the development roadmap for the trading bot system, focusing on trading functionality, symbol selection, backtesting, live trading, self-learning, and scalability.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Initial Setup and Symbol Fetching (Completed)
- [x] Set up project structure and initial files.
- [x] Implement basic logging (`logging_setup.py`).
- [x] Fetch symbols from MEXC via `load_markets()` (`test_symbols.py`).
- [x] Add fallback to public API for symbol fetching (`test_symbols.py`).

### Milestone 2: Symbol Filtering and Validation (Completed)
- [x] Implement symbol validation (`symbol_handler.py`).
- [x] Add filtering by volatility and volume (`token_analyzer.py`, `test_symbols.py`).
- [x] Add filtering by trading signals (RSI) (`signal_generator_indicators.py`, `signal_generator_core.py`, `test_symbols.py`).
- [x] Optimize exchange instance usage to avoid multiple creations (`test_symbols.py`, `symbol_handler.py`, `token_analyzer.py`, `ohlcv_fetcher.py`).
- [x] Add parallel symbol filtering in batches (`test_symbols.py`).
- [x] Add debug logging to track filtering process (`logging_setup.py`, `test_symbols.py`).

### Milestone 3: Backtesting and Live Trading (In Progress)
- [ ] Implement backtesting for selected symbols (`backtest_cycle.py`).
- [ ] Start live trading with symbols that pass backtest (`start_trading_all.py`).
- [ ] Monitor trading performance and log results.

### Milestone 4: Self-Learning and Self-Development (Planned)
- [ ] Implement trade pool storage and synchronization with user cache (`trade_pool_manager.py`, `bot_user_data.py`, `cache_utils.py`).
- [ ] Add data collection for training (`data_collector.py`).
- [ ] Implement model retraining on trade pool data (`retraining_manager.py`).
- [ ] Add dynamic signal generation (`signal_generator_dynamic.py`).
- [ ] Implement market condition analysis for dynamic thresholds (`market_analyzer.py`).
- [ ] Add dynamic threshold adjustment in symbol filtering (`test_symbols.py`).

### Milestone 5: Scalability for 1000+ Users (Planned)
- [ ] Add pre-filtering of symbols by volume (`test_symbols.py`).
- [ ] Implement exchange instance pooling (`exchange_pool.py`).
- [ ] Add asynchronous user processing for 1000+ users (`main.py`).
- [ ] Optimize Redis for scalability (e.g., clustering, memory limits).

### Milestone 6: Market X-Ray Enhancements (Planned)
- [ ] Add additional indicators (MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR) (`signal_generator_indicators.py`).
- [ ] Implement symbol correlation analysis (`market_analyzer.py`).
- [ ] Integrate news analysis for market events (`market_analyzer.py`).

### Milestone 7: Full AI Implementation (Planned)
- [ ] Integrate reinforcement learning for strategy optimization (`retraining_manager.py`).
- [ ] Add neural networks for price/signal prediction (`retraining_manager.py`).
- [ ] Implement unsupervised learning for symbol clustering (`market_analyzer.py`).

### Milestone 8: Enhancements and Notifications (Planned)
- [ ] Add Telegram notifications for trades and errors (`notification_manager.py`).
- [ ] Add unit tests for critical components.

## Current Status
- As of 2025-04-01, the system is in the symbol filtering phase, processing 2610 symbols in batches of 10.
- Filtering criteria have been relaxed (min_volume_threshold=100, min_volatility_threshold=0.1%), and signal filtering is temporarily disabled to allow more symbols to pass.
- Estimated completion of filtering: ~16:06:34 (39 minutes remaining from 15:27:34).
- Awaiting completion of filtering to proceed to backtesting and live trading.

## Next Steps
- Monitor symbol filtering progress and ensure valid symbols are selected.
- Implement trade pool storage and user cache synchronization.
- Add data collection and model retraining for self-learning.
- Implement dynamic signal generation and threshold adjustment.
- Optimize for scalability (pre-filtering, exchange pooling, async user processing).
- Add market x-ray features (indicators, correlations, news analysis).
- Integrate full AI capabilities (reinforcement learning, neural networks, clustering).
- Add Telegram notifications for monitoring.
