# Project Map: Medium and Long-Term Roadmap

## Overview
This file contains the Medium-Term and Long-Term goals for the trading bot project.

## Roadmap

### Medium-Term Goals (1 Month)
- Add support for multiple exchanges (e.g., Binance, Bybit) and distribute users across them.
- Implement ML-based parameter optimization for strategies using historical data.
- Add a queue system to process users in batches (e.g., 50 users) to avoid API overload.
- Implement system performance monitoring (trade execution time, API request count, memory usage).
- Add volatility forecasting with an ML model to adapt strategy parameters.
- Implement automatic deposit updates via exchange API (e.g., every hour).

### Long-Term Goals (3-6 Months)
- Implement adaptive strategies that switch based on market conditions (e.g., trending, counter-trending, scalping).
- Add automated risk management (dynamic position sizing, stop-losses).
- Develop a web interface for monitoring and managing trades (dashboard with PNL, user stats, strategy settings).
- Conduct load testing with 1000+ users and optimize for high load.
- Add notifications (e.g., via Telegram) for critical errors or successful trades for administrators.
- Update CUDA driver to 12.x to enable full GPU support for `local_model_api.py` (GPT-2).
