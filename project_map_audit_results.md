# Trading Bot Audit Results Map

## Overview
This document tracks the audit results and issues encountered during the development of the trading bot system, focusing on symbol selection, backtesting, and live trading.

## Audit Results

### Issue 1: Timeout in `load_markets()` (Resolved)
- **Description**: Initial attempts to fetch symbols via `load_markets()` failed due to timeouts.
- **Resolution**: Added fallback to public API (`https://api.mexc.com/api/v3/exchangeInfo`) in `test_symbols.py`.
- **Date**: 2025-04-01

### Issue 2: Incorrect API Response Handling (Resolved)
- **Description**: Public API response used `status: "1"` instead of `status: "ENABLED"`, causing empty symbol list.
- **Resolution**: Updated `test_symbols.py` to check for `status: "1"` and `isSpotTradingAllowed: true`.
- **Date**: 2025-04-01

### Issue 3: Multiple Exchange Instances (Resolved)
- **Description**: System created multiple exchange instances, leading to performance issues.
- **Resolution**: Passed a single `exchange` instance to `validate_symbol`, `analyze_token`, and `fetch_ohlcv` in `test_symbols.py`, `symbol_handler.py`, `token_analyzer.py`, and `ohlcv_fetcher.py`.
- **Date**: 2025-04-01

### Issue 4: Strict Filtering Criteria (In Progress)
- **Description**: No symbols passed filtering due to strict criteria (volume, volatility, signals).
- **Resolution**: Reduced `min_volume_threshold` to 100, `min_volatility_threshold` to 0.1%, and temporarily disabled signal filtering in `test_symbols.py`. Added debug logging to track filtering.
- **Date**: 2025-04-01

## Current Status
- As of 2025-04-01, the system is filtering 2610 symbols in batches of 10, currently at batch 25 of 261.
- Estimated completion of filtering: ~16:06:34 (39 minutes remaining from 15:27:34).
- Awaiting valid symbols to proceed to backtesting and live trading.

## Next Steps
- Monitor filtering progress and check for valid symbols.
- Re-enable signal filtering with adjusted criteria if needed.
- Proceed to backtesting and live trading.
- Add Telegram notifications for monitoring.
