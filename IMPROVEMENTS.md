# Improvements for Simbiot Trading Bot

## Implemented Improvements
- Added RSI-based trading logic in `start_trading_all.py`.
- Integrated MEXC API for real trading.
- Added logging setup for better debugging.
- Implemented async processing for user handling in `main.py` (users processed in parallel using `asyncio.gather`).
- Added background retraining in `retraining_manager.py` to avoid blocking trading tasks.
- Integrated market analysis modules (`market_analyzer.py`, `market_rentgen_core.py`) for filtering symbols based on volatility, trend, volume spikes, and sentiment.
- Fixed import errors for `MarketAnalyzer` and `MarketRentgenCore` by correcting `market_analyzer.py` and `market_rentgen_core.py`.
- Added dynamic symbol fetching in `test_symbols.py` to automatically find tradable symbols using `fetch_markets()`.
- Integrated CoinGecko API in `historical_data_fetcher.py` as a fallback for historical data when exchange data is unavailable.
- Improved `filter_symbols` in `main.py` with early stopping (after finding 10 symbols) and a fallback list for symbols without historical data.
- Increased CoinGecko data fetching to 90 days for more detailed OHLCV data (up to 2160 points).
- Added request delays and caching for CoinGecko API in `historical_data_fetcher.py` to avoid rate limits and improve performance.
- Increased batch size to 20 and added volume pre-filtering in `main.py` to speed up symbol filtering.

## Planned Improvements
- Optimize for 1000+ users (e.g., connection pooling, rate limiting).
- Add risk management module.
- Enhance market analysis with AI-based predictions.
- Improve CoinGecko symbol mapping for broader token support.
- Add advanced symbol activity checks (e.g., minimum trading volume).
- Add Binance API as an additional data source for historical data.
