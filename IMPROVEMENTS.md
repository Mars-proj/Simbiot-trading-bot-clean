# Improvements for Simbiot Trading Bot

## Implemented Improvements
- Added RSI-based trading logic in `start_trading_all.py`.
- Integrated MEXC API for real trading.
- Added logging setup for better debugging.
- Implemented async processing for user handling in `main.py` (users processed in parallel using `asyncio.gather`).
- Added background retraining in `retraining_manager.py` to avoid blocking trading tasks.
- Integrated market analysis modules (`market_analyzer.py`, `market_rentgen_core.py`) for filtering symbols based on volatility, trend, volume spikes, and sentiment.
- Fixed import errors for `MarketAnalyzer` and `MarketRentgenCore` by correcting `market_analyzer.py` and `market_rentgen_core.py`.

## Planned Improvements
- Optimize for 1000+ users (e.g., connection pooling, rate limiting).
- Add risk management module.
- Enhance market analysis with AI-based predictions.
