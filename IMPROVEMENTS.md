# Trading Bot Improvements

This document lists proposed improvements for the Trading Bot system to make it a fully self-learning, self-evolving market X-ray system scalable for 1000+ users.

## Implemented Improvements
- **Extended Historical Data Fetching**: Increased the time range for `fetch_historical_data` from 30 to 90 days, allowing for 41 data points for RSI calculation (previously 5).
- **Handled Empty trade_data**: Updated `ml_data_preparer.py` to handle cases where `trade_data` is empty by using an alternative method for target variable `y` (comparing consecutive close prices).
- **Improved Trade Data Collection**: Updated `collect_training_data` in `data_collector.py` to fetch recent trades via `fetch_my_trades`, but currently returns empty due to lack of trades.

## Proposed Improvements

### Self-Learning
- [ ] Integrate LSTM and RL models in `retraining_manager.py` for better prediction accuracy.
- [ ] Expand training data in `ml_data_preparer.py` by adding more features (e.g., Bollinger Bands, ATR, MACD).

### Self-Evolving
- [ ] Implement parameter adaptation (leverage, trade_percentage, margin_multiplier) in `start_trading_all.py` based on market conditions.
- [ ] Add genetic algorithm optimization in `strategy_optimizer.py` to dynamically optimize trading parameters.

### Market X-Ray System
- [ ] Add Bollinger Bands and ATR in `signal_generator_indicators.py` for better signal generation.
- [ ] Implement correlation analysis in `market_analyzer.py` to identify market trends.
- [ ] Add news analysis in `news_analyzer.py` to incorporate external market events.

### Scalability
- [ ] Test system with 1000+ users to ensure scalability.
- [ ] Optimize Redis by increasing `maxmemory` and adding clustering for better performance.
- [ ] Add rate limiting in `exchange_pool.py` to prevent API rate limit issues.

### Additional Features
- [ ] Add Telegram notifications in `notification_manager.py` for real-time alerts.
- [ ] Implement unit tests for critical components (e.g., `filter_symbols`, `collect_training_data`).

## Immediate Tasks
- **Fix `collect_training_data`**:
  - Investigate why `fetch_my_trades` returns an empty list for `user1` and `user2`.
  - Consider using historical trades for a specific symbol (e.g., `BTCUSDT`) as a fallback if no user trades are available.
- **Fix Symbol Filtering**:
  - Add more debug logging in `filter_symbols` to identify the exact cause of the failure on `TGTUSDT`.
  - Check `backtest_results.json` for potential data corruption or missing entries.
